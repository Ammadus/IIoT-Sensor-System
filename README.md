The next-generation machinery, viz., turbines, aircrafts, and boilers will rely heavily on smart data acquisition and monitoring to meet their performance and reliability requirements. These systems require the precise acquisition of various parameters like pressure, temperature, and heatflux in real time for structural health monitoring, automation, and intelligent control. This calls for the use of sophisticated instrumentation to measure these parameters and transmit them in real time. In the present work, a wireless sensor network (WSN) based on a novel high-temperature thermocouple-cum-heat flux sensor has been proposed.Â The thermocouple-cum-heatflux sensor and instrumentation enclosure have been designed using rigorous finite element modeling. The sensor and wireless transmission unit are housed in an enclosure capable of withstanding temperature and pressure in the range of 100 bars and 2500 K, respectively. This system uploads the data to a cloud database in real time. Thus, it provides seamless data availability to decision-maker sitting across the globe without any time lag and with ultra-low power consumption.
